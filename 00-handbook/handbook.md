## Learning outcomes [MSc in general + this module] 


### Knowledge and understanding:

-   a comprehensive knowledge of cognitive neuroscience methods

-   a thorough understanding of optimal experimental design • basic
    principles in areas of the neurosciences **Intellectual skills:**

-   critically appraise and summarise information related to brain
    imaging, taking into account the provisional nature of facts and
    principles in cognitive/clinical/computational neuroscience

-   be familiar with scientific methods, including the ability to
    collect and integrate information from the literature

-   to design experiments, execute experimental investigations or other
    relevant methods for testing a hypothesis

-   undertake independent, self-directed research, taking into account
    ethical considerations

-   apply knowledge in brain imaging and cognitive/ clinical/
    computational neuroscience to address research problems • acquire,
    interpret and/or critically analyse research data
    
### Professional/Practical Skills

-   design and carry out appropriate experiments or procedures to test a
    hypothesis, including practical skills such as programming for
    stimulus setup and analysis, collect, record and/or analyse data
    from accurate observations and measurements **Transferable (key)
    skills:**

-   systematically search for literature, evaluate neuroscientific
    research, and draw justified conclusions from the evidence

-   communicate knowledge or arguments (both orally and in writing) to a
    variety of audiences and to evaluate the views of others
