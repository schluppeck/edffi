## Learning outcomes [MSc in general + this module] 

### Knowledge and understanding

- a comprehensive knowledge of cognitive neuroscience methods

- a thorough understanding of optimal experimental design • basic
    principles in areas of the neurosciences **Intellectual skills:**

- critically appraise and summarise information related to brain
    imaging, taking into account the provisional nature of facts and
    principles in cognitive/clinical/computational neuroscience

- be familiar with scientific methods, including the ability to
    collect and integrate information from the literature

- to design experiments, execute experimental investigations or other
    relevant methods for testing a hypothesis

- undertake independent, self-directed research, taking into account
    ethical considerations

- apply knowledge in brain imaging and cognitive/ clinical/
    computational neuroscience to address research problems • acquire,
    interpret and/or critically analyse research data

### Professional/Practical Skills

- design and carry out appropriate experiments or procedures to test a
    hypothesis, including practical skills such as programming for
    stimulus setup and analysis, collect, record and/or analyse data
    from accurate observations and measurements **Transferable (key)
    skills:**

- systematically search for literature, evaluate neuroscientific
    research, and draw justified conclusions from the evidence

- communicate knowledge or arguments (both orally and in writing) to a
    variety of audiences and to evaluate the views of others
