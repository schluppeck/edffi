## Target students

- Compulsory for MSc Cognitive Neuroscience students. 
- Optional for 4th year MSci at Psychology. 

## Summary of content

This module introduces important principles of experimental design and how they link to data analysis. Specific lectures will cover: how to design neuroimaging experiments to address basic and cognitive neruoscience questions; consideration for conducting experiments; steps involved in analysing neuroimaging data, with particular emphasis on functional magnetic resonance imaging.
