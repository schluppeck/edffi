Some materials for *Experimental Design for Functional Imaging*, which is a core module for the [MSc Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/pgstudy/course/taught/cognitive-neuroscience-msc) at the [University of Nottingham](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/psychology/)

2025, denis schluppeck


## Target students

- Compulsory for MSc Cognitive Neuroscience students.
- Optional for MSc Computational Neuroscience, Cognition and AI  
- Optional for 4th year MSci at Psychology.

## Summary of content

This module introduces important principles of experimental design and how they link to data analysis. Specific lectures will cover: how to design neuroimaging experiments to address basic and cognitive neruoscience questions; consideration for conducting experiments; steps involved in analysing neuroimaging data, with particular emphasis on functional magnetic resonance imaging.
