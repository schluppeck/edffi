## Today

::: fragment
**Assessment**

-   A bit more detail on the written assessment
-   General advice on writing, structure
:::

::: fragment
**The General Linear Model (GLM)**

-   intuition / non-mathematical explanation
-   some of the nitty-gritty (in `matlab`)
-   demo in `fsl`
:::

::: fragment
**Kinds of designs**

- task, resting state, connectivity, ...
:::

## Learning objectives

By the end of the lecture you should:

-   know what's expected in coursework
-   have all the information to get started on assessment
-   understand the GLM in principle
-   appreciate some of the technical details of GLM analysis
-   have some knowledge of different kinds of "designs" / approaches to fMRI for neuroscience

## Assessment

-   Written assignment (max 3000 words) including a 250 word abstract.

-   Details on [moodle (2023/24)](https://moodle.nottingham.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=137636#section-11).

> The written assignment for this module is an essay about how functional magnetic resonance imaging and/or brain stimulation can be used to study different neuroscience questions. It should cover two topics and/or methods from the course.

## Not just a literature review

> One aim of the assignment is to make you think about the methodological choices the experimenters have to make. After a brief summary of the state of the literature in your area, there should be therefore be a component that talks about how you might extend some previous findings.

## Guided submission {.scrollable}

There are very specific suggestions for how you can tackle each section in turn

**overall word limit, 3000w - stick to this limit**)

- Title of project (suggested ~10 words)
- Lay Summary (max 250 words, one paragraph)
- Scientific Summary (max 250 words, one paragraph)
- Background of the project (suggested 600 words)
- Questions to be answered (suggested 200 words) 
- Plan of investigation (suggested 500 words)
- Details of data analysis (suggested 500 words)
- Expected outcomes (suggested 200 words & 1-2 figures)
- Theoretical & practical implications (suggested 500 words)
- References


## Things that you might wonder about:

- Plan of investigation (suggested 500 words)

>But I don't have any data (yet?). How to square that circle??

## What do we look for?

::: fragment
**Content**

The **content** of your coursework is (obviously) important - topic choice - methodological details included - facts correct?
:::

::: fragment
**... but writing!**

-   clear, concise, economic
-   line of argument?
-   structure easy to follow
-   ...

## The GLM - a quick walk-through

### Some notes for my demo

``` bash
cd ~/projects/hands-on-brain-data
julia
# using Pluto
# Pluto.run()
# "what_is_linearReg.jl"
```

## in `matlab`

### Some notes for my demo

``` matlab
cd ~/projects/hands-on-brain-data
cd data
X = load('design-3.txt')
y = load('timecourse.txt')
X\y
% regress(), pinv()
```

## in `fsl`

``` bash
cd ~/projects/hands-on-brain-data
cd data
fsleyes filtered_func_data
fsl &
# simple block design ... stats: 6, (12, 12, 12)
```

## in `fsl`/`fsleyes`

## Kinds of designs / approaches

Two directions, in which people elaborate experiments: 

1. **tasks, stimuli** have become more sophisticated
2. **data analysis methods** are changing all the time

## Tasks

You can find lots of versions of these across all domains of cognitive neuroscience...

::: {.incremental}
- task-based experiments
  - block designs, event-related designs, mixed, ...
  - "continuous" (eg watching movies)
- resting state fMRI (rsFMRI)
:::

## Analysis methods

- GLM, linear regression (the "workhorse" of fMRI analysis)

- data-driven methods (search for patterns in the data)
  - *independent component analysis*, ICA (dimensionality reduction techniques)
  - seed-based correlation methods
  - network analysis, ...

- machine learning, *decoding*

## GLM


We have just seen a bit more of this in action


## Resting state fMRI
![example rs analysis](images/smith-fig-1-rs.png)

[Smith et al, 2012, PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1121329109)

## Decoding, multivariate analysis

Variously: *classification*, SVM (support vector machines), decoding, even "mind reading", ...

::: {.fragment}
**Aim:** try to use **data** - the pattern of activity across many voxels (and trials) - to figure out which stimulus was being displayed.
